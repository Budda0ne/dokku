# 0.36.0 Migration Guide

## Changes

- Process stop timeouts are now configured via the `ps` property `stop-timeout-seconds`. Existing `DOKKU_DOCKER_STOP_TIMEOUT` environment variables will be automatically migrated to the new value.
- Processes now default to a `30` second stop timeout.
- The `domains:clear` command no longer runs domain setup after clearing the domains. Use `domains:reset` or run `domains:setup` manually to have the same effect.
- The deprecated `DOKKU_DISABLE_ANSI_PREFIX_REMOVAL` setting has been removed. Dokku deploys no longer use shell escape codes to modify output, and thus deploy output may now contain `remote:` as a prefix in each lines output.

## Deprecations

Ubuntu 20.04 is now a deprecated installation target. The operating system will be considered EOL by Canonical in April 2025. Users are encouraged to upgrade to Ubuntu 24.04 or consider switching their instllation method to the [Docker-based installation method](/docs/getting-started/install/docker.md) to avoid any disruption in usage.
