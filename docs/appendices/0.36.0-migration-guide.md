# 0.35.0 Migration Guide

## Changes

- Process stop timeouts are now configured via the `ps` property `stop-timeout-seconds`. Existing `DOKKU_DOCKER_STOP_TIMEOUT` environment variables will be automatically migrated to the new value.
- Processes now default to a `30` second stop timeout.
- The `domains:clear` command no longer runs domain setup after clearing the domains. Use `domains:reset` or run `domains:setup` manually to have the same effect.
- The deprecated `DOKKU_DISABLE_ANSI_PREFIX_REMOVAL` setting has been removed. Dokku deploys no longer use shell escape codes to modify output, and thus deploy output may now contain `remote:` as a prefix in each lines output.
